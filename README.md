# Modbus-Sniff
Modbus/TCP sniffing Lab via Factory IO and OpenPLC
I have created a Lab environment for sniff and analyze Modbus/TCP traffic in this repo.

For this:

OpenPLC Editor: Used for creating and compiling PLC program.
OpenPLC: Works as PLC and HMI. 
Factory IO: Contains 3D models of actuators.
